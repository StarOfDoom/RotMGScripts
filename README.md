# RotMGScripts

Hotkey scripts to edit RotMG commands at the press of a button. Only works on 059's client. Inspired by the AHK script that has been floating around.

## Getting Started

Download a release version from [releases](https://github.com/StarOfDoom/RotMGScripts/releases), extract to an empty folder, and run the .exe to get started.

## Building the Source

Steps to build source:

```
1. Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)
2. Download the source code and extract to a folder
3. Open the .sln in Visual Studio
4. Build the program
```

## Why Open Source?

I decided to make this program open source because there has been a lot of clients and programs that steal credentials in the RotMG community. I have no need to hide it and I also need to work on documentation, so I decided to take this opportunity to do so.
