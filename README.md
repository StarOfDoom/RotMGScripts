# RotMGScripts

Hotkey scripts to edit RotMG commands at the press of a button. Inspired by the AHK script that has been floating around.

**Only works on 059's client, has not been tested with steam.**

## Getting Started

Download a release version from [releases](https://github.com/StarOfDoom/RotMGScripts/releases), extract to an empty folder, and run the .exe.
Run 059's client and create the scripts with the settings you'd like, has only been tested with the .swf Flashplayer version.
If you renamed the flashplayer process, ensure to change the name to your current flashplayer's name.

## Console Commands

Currently there are very few console commands, but more will be added shortly:

```
"hook"/"rehook" - Hooks into the keyboard if it gets unhooked or doesn't hook properly.
"unhook" - Unhooks from the keyboard, meaning you can no longer use hotkeys.
```

## Building the Source

Steps to build source:

```
1. Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)
2. Download the source code and extract to a folder
3. Open the .sln in Visual Studio
4. Build the program
```

## Why Open Source?

I decided to make this program open source because there has been a lot of clients and programs that steal credentials in the RotMG community. I have no need to hide it and I also need to work on documentation, so I decided to take this opportunity to do so.
